            <h4 id="h4444">Feeding Your Kids</h4>
            <p id="text">Do you want your child to eat a nutritious meal today? As it happens, parents make a lot of
                decisions before that one meal gets on the table tonight. Any one of those decisions can sabotage the
                hoped-for outcome. At the same time, feeding your kids in a healthy way is only one of your objectives among
                the many you have in running busy lives. Do you also want not only that tonight‚Äôs dinner is eaten, but that
                your child develops healthy eating habits for life? Raising a healthy eater is complicated. Studies show
                that when it comes to behavior, people learn best by taking tiny doable practical steps. The program
                sequences the small doable practical changes daily, and that adds up to a big result at the end. When you
                start the program, you will have an opportunity to assess how you make the decisions related to feeding.</p><br>

            <br>
        <p id="t2">Given children consume up to one-third of their total daily food intake at school, packing a
            nutritious lunchbox is important for their ongoing growth and development. Plus, a healthy lunch and
            snacks help maintain energy levels throughout the day, essential for both study and playBelow we have put
            together some tips for creating an attractive and rich lunch box to encourage students to eat it.

                            sugar, <br><br>so have it occasionally. The best left out of the lunch box are dried fruit
                            bars and ‚Äòstraps, which are very high in sugar, low in fiber, and stick to children‚Äôs
                            teeth.<br><br> Try vegetable sticks with dip or a small container with mixed vegetables such

                            Children enjoy mini packaged cheeses.For those wondering what kind of cheese can
                            a kid eat,<br><br> here is an examples:Cheddar,Parmesan, Colby, Mozzarella and Swiss. Avoid
                            sweet dips such as chocolate spreads.<br><br> ‚ÄòOven-baked‚Äô savory biscuits are just as high
                            in salt and fat as chips and are best avoided. </p>
