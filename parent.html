                        <!--p>You don’t need to be a science expert to help your child make discoveries about science
                            in the world around you. All you need is an open mind and a willingness to join the
                            exploration. It’s fun and a great way to support your child’s science learning.</p-->
                        <!--h3>Tips for Parents</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take time to look, wonder, and try things out together. For example, if
                                your child notices a dripping faucet, an interesting rock, or a weed in the
                                sidewalk, stop to examine it closely</li>
                            <li>Let your child take the lead in exploring things. Notice what catches
                                your child’s interest. Is it the weed, the crumbling pavement, or the tiny
                                insects nearby?</li>
                            <li>Ask questions to keep the exploration going. You might say, Wow! Did
                                you see...? Listen to the sounds the drops make when they hit the water.
                                I wonder what would happen if...?
                            </li>
                            <li>It’s OK to say, “I don’t know” when your child asks you hard-to-answer
                                questions. You can also say, Maybe we can fi nd out together. Then visit
                                your local library, museum, or zoo and see what new information you
                                can discover</li>
                            <li>Visit our Web site, peepandthebigwideworld.org, with your child. Watch
                                Peep episodes, play science and math games created especially for young
                                kids, fi nd easy, fun family ideas for exploring everyday science,

                        <h4>Searching for Shadows</h4>
                        <p>Go outside on a sunny day with your child. Ask: Where is your shadow? What other
                            shadows can you see? Hop, dance, and do silly walks together. Watch how your
                            shadows move. <br>
                            Take a walk with your shadows. Notice what happens to your shadows when they fall
                            on a wall, some steps, or a bench.</p>
                        <h4>Shadow Theater </h4>
                        <p>Turn on a lamp or fl ashlight in a darkened room. Have your child join you in moving
                            your hands in front of the light and watching the shadows on the wall. Ask your child:
                            How can you make your shadow bigger? Smaller? What shadow shapes can you make
                            with your hands? <br>
                            Put on a shadow play! Use your hands to make shadows that look like a fl apping bird,
                            a quacking duck, or a running spider. Or use toys and household objects as shadow
                            puppets. You can also make shadow puppets out of paper—cut out shapes and tape
                            them to the top of a ruler, drinking straw, or unsharpened pencil.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Painting with Water</h4>
                        <p>On a warm day, pour water on different outdoor surfaces, like dirt,
                            sand, grass, and concrete. What happens to the water? Does it form
                            droplets, puddles, or streams? Does it soak in?
                            <br>
                            Make water pictures by dribbling water on sand or dirt. Use a
                            paintbrush and water or an ice cube to paint a water picture on concrete.
                            <br>
                            Notice how the water pictures change as time passes. Ask your child,
                            What’s happening? Why do you think that’s happening?
                        </p>
                        <h4>Making Bathtub Boats</h4>
                        <p>Collect everyday items like plastic containers, sponges, pieces of wood,
                            metal spoons, rocks, and Styrofoam packing materials.
                            <br>
                            Invite your child to try fl oating these objects in the bathtub.
                            Which ones fl oat? How can your child make these “boats” sink?
                        </p>
                        <h4>Flowing with the Current</h4>
                        <p>Turn on a garden hose and let water fl ow slowly over a hard surface.
                            Have your child gently place small fl oating objects, like twigs and leaves,
                            into the water. Notice what happens. Which way do the objects go?</p>

                            <h4>Plants Outdoors</h4>
                            <p>Take time to look at plants with your child. Look for big plants, like trees and bushes.
                                Look for small plants growing on the ground and in sidewalk cracks. <br>
                                Talk about what you see. You might say, Let’s see if we can fi nd two plants that look
                                the
                                same. Can we fi nd a plant with a fuzzy stem? What’s the smallest plant we can fi nd?
                                Look at
                                all the different shades of green! What other colors do you see? <br>
                                Help your child learn to respect the environment. Only
                                collect parts of plants that have fallen on the ground
                                (such as twigs, leaves, and nuts).</p>
                            <h4>Plants We Eat</h4>
                            <p>At the grocery store, let your child help choose leaf
                                vegetables (like lettuce and spinach), root vegetables (like
                                carrots and beets), and vegetables that are actually fruits
                                (ones with seeds, like tomatoes and peppers). <br>
                                The next time you’re slicing fruits or vegetables, let your child
                                guess what sort of seeds are inside. Will the seeds be big or little?
                                Black or white? Will there be lots of seeds or just one? </p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="make-flex">
                        <div class="text float-right ">
                            <h4>Out and About</h4>
                            <p>Look for ramps. As you and your child walk around the neighborhood, see how many
                                ramps you can fi nd. Look for curb cuts in the sidewalk and entrance ramps to public
                                buildings. Let your child try going up and down them. Talk about how ramps can make
                                it easier for people in wheelchairs or with strollers to get around. <br>
                                On the playground, let your child place objects on a slide (a toy animal, a leaf, a
                                stick, a
                                mitten, a ball, etc.) Talk about what happens. I wonder why it moved like that. What do
                                you think made this one move so fast? After experimenting a little, ask your child to
                                predict what an object will do before placing it on the slide</p>
                            <h4>In the House</h4>
                            <p>Let it roll. Build a ramp with your child by propping up one end of a large picture book
                                or
                                a piece of cardboard. Together, collect things that you think will roll down the
                                ramp—for
                                example, a crayon, a toy car, a ball, a toilet paper roll. Encourage your child to
                                experiment: What could we do to the ramp to make the objects roll faster?
                                How about more slowly? <br>
                                Tip and roll. Put a piece of paper in a shallow box or a disposable cake
                                or pie pan. Dip a marble in paint, then place it in the box. Let your
                                child tip the box back and forth, noticing which way the marble
                                rolls and the paint tracks it leaves behind. </p>

                            <p>Big steps, little steps. On the sidewalk or driveway, use chalk to measure your foot and
                                your child’s foot. Ask: Whose foot is bigger? Whose foot is smaller? Count how many
                                steps
                                it takes to get to a destination, putting one foot in front of the other, heel-to-toe.
                                Talk
                                about the results: Why do you think you made more steps and I made fewer steps? Don’t
                                be surprised if your child thinks you made more steps because your feet are bigger!
                                <br>
                                Rocks and pebbles. Fill a small bag with an item you fi nd outside, such as rocks. Talk
                                about what you are doing: Let’s fi nd some big rocks to fi ll this bag. Empty the bag
                                and put
                                the items in a pile. Then choose something smaller, such as pebbles. Ask: Do you think
                                we’ll need more little pebbles than big rocks to fi ll up the bag? Empty the bag again
                                and
                                compare the two piles.
                            </p>
                            <h4>In the House</h4>
                            <p>Tall, taller, tallest. Talk about how much your child has grown since he or she was a
                                baby.
                                When you were born, you were about as long as that backpack. You are so much bigger
                                and taller now! Using paper towel rolls, measure how tall your child is. Then measure
                                favorite stuffed animals. Use words like tall/taller and short/shorter as you talk about
                                what you discover. <br>
                                Make it, bake it. Choose a simple recipe or ready-made mix. Read the ingredients list
                                with
                                your child and talk about what you’ll need for measuring: teaspoons, tablespoons, cups.
                                Have your child help you measure each ingredient. We need one cup of milk and one
                                teaspoon of cinnamon. Look, a teaspoon is just a small amount.</p>
